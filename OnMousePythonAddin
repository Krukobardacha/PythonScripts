The function onMouseDown will return a set of pixel values showing the coordinates 
of where you clicked, measured in pixels from the upper left of the map display window.

The function onMouseDownMap is sensitive to your current view. If you are in data view, 
it returns coordinates in the map's coordinate system. If you are in layout view, it returns coordinates in page units
- but only allows you to click inside the data frame element.
